In June 2007 it was the 20th anniversary of the passing of legislation to make New Zealand nuclear free.  Maynie Thompson was interviewed on Island Life discussing her involvement in the anti-nuclear movement in the 1980s.\n\nMaynie was an amazing woman, on first name terms with both Davis Lange and Helen Clark. In this interview she discussed the inspiration for her involvement in the anti-nuclear movement and some of her adventures as a front line activist.\n\nWaiheke became a hotbed of activism in the eighties and Maynie and other local women found they had plenty of support as they took their message of peace to the world. In 1983 she participated in a march to Wellington calling for the New Zealand government to take a stand on the nuclear issue. Enthused by that experience, a year later Maynie visited Britain to join the womenâs camp at Greenham Common protesting the deployment of American nuclear missiles on British soil. She wasn’t merely a passive participant in this protest, she was involved in cutting the fence and raiding the Greenham Common military complex.\n\nTwo years later Maynie again ventured overseas to participate in the Great Peace March across the United States walking much of the way from Los Angeles to Washington DC again calling for peace and an end to the nuclear threat.\n\nMaynie’s activism continued into the 1990s with her participation in the 1995 Peace Flight to Tahiti. This action was to protest French Nuclear testing on the Pacific atoll Mururoa and to lend support to the indigenous people of Tahiti and other Pacific nations who were in the region were the French chose to carry out their nuclear dirty work.\n\nMayni dedicated many years to the campaign for peace and in this interview she emphasised the overwhelming support she had received from the Waiheke community over this time. She could justifiably look back on her involvement in the peace movement with pride.",

            "summary": "Waiheke Finally Presented the Roger Award to Auckland City Councillors Cathy Casey, Denise Roche, and Richard Northey at a lively Artworks Ceremony on Saturday.  \n\nAmidst much hilarity and some sombreness, the award was finally accepted by the City Vision Councillors on behalf of Auckland City Council.  \n\nDenise Roche spoke of conflicts of interest, John of the shenanigans that led to the final decision (unfortunately the recording mechanism failed so you’ll need to see him if you want the gory details).\n\nCathy Casey spoke poignantly about the personal stress of the campaign and the fear that went with feeling that her emails were being looked at and passed around without her knowledge.  \n\nMany spoke of their fears for the new Supercity but some felt these fears may well be opportunities in disguise.  Mike Lee spoke of the self-governance opportunities that might arise, Jacinda Ardern spoke of her amendment to the third supercity bill to transfer waste management powers to the Waiheke Community Board.    David Clendon spoke of the travesty of justice that the contract was awarded to a multi-national over a local provider.  \n\nFor most of the people who had joined the fight at various stages the event represented closure and the recognition that although the battle was lost, Waiheke was radicalised into opposition to the Supercity.   \n\nSee the press release below for additional details.  \n\nAt this time last year the Waiheke community was in the midst of a battle to preserve its innovative waste management programme. The programme had been widely hailed as a model for the rest of New Zealand, with articles in the major magazines touting the advances made by The Waste Resource Trust and Clean Stream. Waiheke’s campaign to keep its highly successful programme, called Waiheke Does It Better, made news across the country with a music video that circulated on the internet and an appearance on Campbell Live as well as articles in nationwide publications. \n\nAlthough the C and R-dominated Auckland City Council Community Development Committee ignored its own waste management policy and the stated wishes of the Waiheke Community Board representing island residents by awarding the contract to TPI, some interesting things have come out of it.  The term \"Mt. Visy\", coined by a Waiheke resident, is now the de facto name for the Onehunga MRF. Waiheke’s campaign is also frequently cited in Parliament as an example of poor governmental consultation. TPI meets with  a group of Waiheke community members reglualry to montor their progress and see if they can attain the waste recovery percentage that Clean Stream achieved. Waiheke is the only community to enjoy that privilege. And this year, an independent panel awarded ACC the Accomplice Roger Award for the role they played in giving the Waste Tender to the dodgy multi-national, TPI. \n\nThe award, however, has yet to be presented. Unsurprisingly, the CDC did not acknowledge receipt of the award. Now, a group of Waiheke Residents, headed by Millie Watkins, have put together an Award Ceremony at Artworks Theatre on 22 May, 2pm, to give the Roger Award presentation its due.  The ceremony will be attended by Mike Lee of ARC, Jacinda Ardern, Labour MP and David Clendon, Green Party MP. Denise Roche, Cathy Casey and Richard Northey will be on hand to accept the award on behalf of the rest of the Auckland City Councillors. Two of the Roger Award judges, Joce Jessen and Wayne Hope will officially present the award. \n\nThe event on Saturday will close the chapter on the Waiheke Does It Better campaign. Many people put extensive amounts of time and energy into preserving a wildly successful  community waste programme, not to mention Clean Stream itself. This Roger Award is for them and the many thousands of supporters on the island and elsewhere. All are invited to come hear the speakers and enjoy refreshments and a cash bar.",

            "summary": "Auckland City Councillors in a full meeting  of council today, resolved to enter into a 10 year contract with TPI  for waste collection as well as operation and redevelopment of the Waiheke transfer station. \n\nIn a 10 minute deputation to the councillors, Peta Rickys spoke about how the tender and the process did not meet guidelines laid down in the Hauraki Gulf Marine Act.  Sue Connor, of Waiheke Does it Better made it clear that people from Waiheke are disgusted by the process that has been followed.  I talked about the fact the Royal Commission suggests a  waste management plan for the Gulf Islands and requested that the councillors defer a decision and maintain the status quo, until that, or the Transition Agency for the supercity, was fully functioning. \n\nCouncillor Northey suggested an amendment to the resolution which in fact asked for tenders to be reopened, with the existing service continuing until the new tender is agreed to. \n\nCouncillors Roche and Casey excused themselves, quoting a conflict of interest.  The City Vision Councillors (Crs Nortthey, Boyle, Easte and Fryer)  then presented arguments to the effect that consultation had not been followed, the decision was exceedingly unpopular and there could be severe legal repercussions. \n\nOfficers John Dutthie, and McQuillan, and CEO David Rankin were asked various questions as to whether protocol had been followed, whether there had been a consultation process, and whether they were satisfied with the financial position of TPI.   City Vision councillors also asked about the status of factually incorrect information which had been passed from Aaron Bhatnagar to the press and the defamation implications of this. \n\nIt seemed glaringly obvious that Citizens and Ratepayer Councillors were engaged in a tick-box exercise.  They were unwilling to consider the social capital and community commitment to a locally based enterprise.  Nor would they consider any misrepresentation or wrongdoing on the part of officers in representing the issues. \n\nThe amendment was defeated, the resolution was passed.\n\nCleanstream will no longer control the contract for island waste management, as from 1 July, 2009.\n\nRead more in next week’s papers.  The meeting was covered by Liz Waters of the Gulf News. \n\nExpress your feelings below on the fact TPI got the contract and Cleanstream were disqualified.  \n\nGo to Waihekedoesitbetter.org.nz to look for further commentary and action. \n\nIt’s a sad day when democratically elected representatives knowingly make decisions to the detriment of their constitutents and communities. \n\nWhat I want to know is what do I do with my recyclables if I don’t want them to end up on the Vissy pile?

            "summary": "This goes out on the 12th of February.  I talk to Cathy, founding member of the Campaign for Fair Ferry Fares.  We talk about the recent reduction in ferry fares on Fullers, quite an achievement as fares have never gone down before.\n\nUntil the start of 2009, the ferry providers could set the prices they wanted, provided the routes were not subsidised.   This meant that market forces only, determined how the fares are set with potentially devastating consequences to the diversity of our community.  \n\nThe Transport Management Act introduced this year means that ARTA (the Auckland Regional Transport Authority) now have the capacity to regulate prices on the route.   I talk with Cathy about the implications of the Act, how fares can be set fairly, and what needs to be done to ensure they are. \n\nWe also talk about the colourful campaigning, involving a coffin protest on Septmeber 1, 2009 when fares were put up last.  Listen to the sea shanty at the end of the show or as a separate podcast below.   This protest was followed by  a Fair Ferry Fairy,   and Piracy on the High Seas protest. \n\nThe public support for the campaign has been immense, with reporting in the local and national newspapers.  We also talk about how the public can participate and support the campaign. \n\nLook out for the Draft Transport Management Plan for Waiheke which is coming up in April – what are your integrated transport solutions to the island? \n\nLinks yuu might find useful:\n\nhttp://fullerswatch.blogspot.com\n\nTo comment on the ferries and any problems on journeys (and good things that happen).\n\nhttp://en-gb.facebook.com/group.php?gid=26919026922   takes you to the \"We hate Fullers and their poxy price rise,\" a spontaneous blog set up by students commuting to the city on Fullers Ferries. \n\nThe Campaign for Fair Ferry Fares can be reached on campaign4fairferryfares@gmail.com\n\nTo listen to the podcast of the interview click the links below.  \n\nIf you just want the Fair Ferries sea shanty by Alan Knight and Friends, you can listen to that separately. \n\nHere’s hoping that the introduction of fair fares will make all this community effort redundant in the coming year!  Until then … happy campaigning.",
