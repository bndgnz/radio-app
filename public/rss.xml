            <description><![CDATA[To conclude our local board election coverage Waiheke Radio hosted a candidates’ meeting at Artworks Theatre on Mon 19 Sept 2016. A couple of notes on this podcast. You will notice that not all candidates answered all questions – they were given the opportunity but some chose not to answer some questions. This was obvious to those in the theatre but we realised after that we hadn’t said that on air. Also, towards the end of the recording gremlins got in and the recording dropped out for a while. Sincere apologies to Paul Walden, whose summing statement is cut off and Cath Handley whose summing up statement is completely missing.

Bob Upchurch and Irene Armstrong both wanted to be at the meeting but had unchangeable prior arrangements and tendered apologies.

Many thanks to Artworks Theatre, the candidates and the people who turned up on the night.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Matariki at Waiheke High School is by many accounts uniquely celebrated. The school’s four houses spend considerable time learning new waiata and practicing and honing the school haka in preparation for the day’s festivities. These festivities include competetive performances, speeches, and presentations from faculties. The day culminates in the sharing of kai from the hangi that is lit at 4am on the school grounds and feeds over 650 people.

On this 9th year of Matariki at Waiheke High school I recorded part of the Piringakau Kapa Haka group’s performance of “The Legends of Maui”; I also recorded a walk across the campus as houses practiced for the next day’s house competitions. The day of Matariki celebration features recordings of Canto Isola, a speech on the history of Matariki at the school by Whaea Huhana, as well as some house performances of waiata and haka.

Recorded and produced by Brent Simpson.]]></description>

As part of the Waiheke Radio training course currently being run by Chris Walker, Thomas and Clive have been working on some ideas for a Boating Show on the radio.  On Waiheke Island, we are surrounded by water and everyone has experienced boating in one form or another be it on the Ferries, sailing dinghies or larger boats and of course, the recreational  fishing. Plenty of boats around Waiheke Island!

In this interview, Thomas talks to Clive about living aboard his boat. This is a Pilot for some of those ideas – if you have any suggestions for boating topics or stories to add, please email us at studio@waiheke.org.nz with the subject line “Boating Show”.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Maynie Thompson , a staunch activist and proponent of the peace movement, passed away over the weekend, aged 98. In June 2007 it was the 20th anniversary of the passing of legislation to make New Zealand nuclear free.  Maynie Thompson was interviewed on Island Life discussing her involvement in the anti-nuclear movement in the 1980s.

Maynie was an amazing woman, on first name terms with both Davis Lange and Helen Clark. In this interview she discussed the inspiration for her involvement in the anti-nuclear movement and some of her adventures as a front line activist.

Waiheke became a hotbed of activism in the eighties and Maynie and other local women found they had plenty of support as they took their message of peace to the world. In 1983 she participated in a march to Wellington calling for the New Zealand government to take a stand on the nuclear issue. Enthused by that experience, a year later Maynie visited Britain to join the womenâs camp at Greenham Common protesting the deployment of American nuclear missiles on British soil. She wasn’t merely a passive participant in this protest, she was involved in cutting the fence and raiding the Greenham Common military complex.

Two years later Maynie again ventured overseas to participate in the Great Peace March across the United States walking much of the way from Los Angeles to Washington DC again calling for peace and an end to the nuclear threat.

Maynie’s activism continued into the 1990s with her participation in the 1995 Peace Flight to Tahiti. This action was to protest French Nuclear testing on the Pacific atoll Mururoa and to lend support to the indigenous people of Tahiti and other Pacific nations who were in the region were the French chose to carry out their nuclear dirty work.

Mayni dedicated many years to the campaign for peace and in this interview she emphasised the overwhelming support she had received from the Waiheke community over this time. She could justifiably look back on her involvement in the peace movement with pride.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Well done Waiheke! A massive community mobilisation saw Waiheke produce a huge number of submissions to the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance. In fact, we make up around only 0.6% of the population of the greater Auckland area but put in around a third of the submissions and forced a hearing of the commission right here on Waiheke.

The majority of submissions from Waiheke emphasised the need for decision making that takes account of our unique local needs. In response the Royal Commission has made the following recommendation.

Waiheke and Great Barrier Island Community Boards should have greater delegated powers than at present, including the management of community halls and reserves, and powers to decide on some local services covered by a budget allocation.

The full report, executive summary and recommendations of the Royal commission can be found here.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Waiheke Finally Presented the Roger Award to Auckland City Councillors Cathy Casey, Denise Roche, and Richard Northey at a lively Artworks Ceremony on Saturday.  

Amidst much hilarity and some sombreness, the award was finally accepted by the City Vision Councillors on behalf of Auckland City Council.  

Denise Roche spoke of conflicts of interest, John of the shenanigans that led to the final decision (unfortunately the recording mechanism failed so you’ll need to see him if you want the gory details).

Cathy Casey spoke poignantly about the personal stress of the campaign and the fear that went with feeling that her emails were being looked at and passed around without her knowledge.  

Many spoke of their fears for the new Supercity but some felt these fears may well be opportunities in disguise.  Mike Lee spoke of the self-governance opportunities that might arise, Jacinda Ardern spoke of her amendment to the third supercity bill to transfer waste management powers to the Waiheke Community Board.    David Clendon spoke of the travesty of justice that the contract was awarded to a multi-national over a local provider.  

For most of the people who had joined the fight at various stages the event represented closure and the recognition that although the battle was lost, Waiheke was radicalised into opposition to the Supercity.   

See the press release below for additional details.  

At this time last year the Waiheke community was in the midst of a battle to preserve its innovative waste management programme. The programme had been widely hailed as a model for the rest of New Zealand, with articles in the major magazines touting the advances made by The Waste Resource Trust and Clean Stream. Waiheke’s campaign to keep its highly successful programme, called Waiheke Does It Better, made news across the country with a music video that circulated on the internet and an appearance on Campbell Live as well as articles in nationwide publications. 

Although the C&R-dominated Auckland City Council Community Development Committee ignored its own waste management policy and the stated wishes of the Waiheke Community Board representing island residents by awarding the contract to TPI, some interesting things have come out of it.  The term "Mt. Visy", coined by a Waiheke resident, is now the de facto name for the Onehunga MRF. Waiheke’s campaign is also frequently cited in Parliament as an example of poor governmental consultation. TPI meets with  a group of Waiheke community members reglualry to montor their progress and see if they can attain the waste recovery percentage that Clean Stream achieved. Waiheke is the only community to enjoy that privilege. And this year, an independent panel awarded ACC the Accomplice Roger Award for the role they played in giving the Waste Tender to the dodgy multi-national, TPI. 

The award, however, has yet to be presented. Unsurprisingly, the CDC did not acknowledge receipt of the award. Now, a group of Waiheke Residents, headed by Millie Watkins, have put together an Award Ceremony at Artworks Theatre on 22 May, 2pm, to give the Roger Award presentation its due.  The ceremony will be attended by Mike Lee of ARC, Jacinda Ardern, Labour MP and David Clendon, Green Party MP. Denise Roche, Cathy Casey and Richard Northey will be on hand to accept the award on behalf of the rest of the Auckland City Councillors. Two of the Roger Award judges, Joce Jessen and Wayne Hope will officially present the award. 

The event on Saturday will close the chapter on the Waiheke Does It Better campaign. Many people put extensive amounts of time and energy into preserving a wildly successful  community waste programme, not to mention Clean Stream itself. This Roger Award is for them and the many thousands of supporters on the island and elsewhere. All are invited to come hear the speakers and enjoy refreshments and a cash bar.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On Friday 21 Aug the Local Government Commission released it’s decision on the proposal to have Waiheke become part of the Thames / Coromandel District Council. The propoosal was rejected. The full decision can be read here.

This was a controversial proposal, supported by around 1000 petitioners and opposed by hundreds of submitters. The man who developed and pushed the proposal is Nobilangelo Ceramalus, a member of our Community Board, although he was opposed by the remainder of the board on this issue. Mr Ceramalus outlined his reasoning for the proposal in an interview on Waiheke Radio in March.

So what does the man behind the proposal think of it’s rejection? Mr Ceramalus spoke to Kevin Glover on Island Life Sat 22 Aug, the day after the Local Government Commission’s decision was announced.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On the 1st of November a new form of Auckland city comes into existence. Before then you’ll have the chance to vote for a mayor, a councillor and a new community board. There are 18 candidates standing for 5 positions on the Waiheke Community Board.

In this first of two opportunities to hear from the candidates Waiheke radio has given each of them two minutes to answer the question, "Why should Waiheke people vote for you?"

After you’ve listened to the statements we encourage you to make comment and ask questions. Later in the election process we will ask each candidate back  on-air for an interview which will include your questions. We look forward to your input.]]></description>

            <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[Auckland City Councillors in a full meeting  of council today, resolved to enter into a 10 year contract with TPI  for waste collection as well as operation and redevelopment of the Waiheke transfer station. 

In a 10 minute deputation to the councillors, Peta Rickys spoke about how the tender and the process did not meet guidelines laid down in the Hauraki Gulf Marine Act.  Sue Connor, of Waiheke Does it Better made it clear that people from Waiheke are disgusted by the process that has been followed.  I talked about the fact the Royal Commission suggests a  waste management plan for the Gulf Islands and requested that the councillors defer a decision and maintain the status quo, until that, or the Transition Agency for the supercity, was fully functioning. 

Councillor Northey suggested an amendment to the resolution which in fact asked for tenders to be reopened, with the existing service continuing until the new tender is agreed to. 

Councillors Roche and Casey excused themselves, quoting a conflict of interest.  The City Vision Councillors (Crs Nortthey, Boyle, Easte and Fryer)  then presented arguments to the effect that consultation had not been followed, the decision was exceedingly unpopular and there could be severe legal repercussions. 

Officers John Dutthie, and McQuillan, and CEO David Rankin were asked various questions as to whether protocol had been followed, whether there had been a consultation process, and whether they were satisfied with the financial position of TPI.   City Vision councillors also asked about the status of factually incorrect information which had been passed from Aaron Bhatnagar to the press and the defamation implications of this. 

It seemed glaringly obvious that Citizens and Ratepayer Councillors were engaged in a tick-box exercise.  They were unwilling to consider the social capital and community commitment to a locally based enterprise.  Nor would they consider any misrepresentation or wrongdoing on the part of officers in representing the issues. 

The amendment was defeated, the resolution was passed.

Cleanstream will no longer control the contract for island waste management, as from 1 July, 2009.

Read more in next week’s papers.  The meeting was covered by Liz Waters of the Gulf News. 

Express your feelings below on the fact TPI got the contract and Cleanstream were disqualified.  

Go to Waihekedoesitbetter.org.nz to look for further commentary and action. 

It’s a sad day when democratically elected representatives knowingly make decisions to the detriment of their constitutents and communities. 

What I want to know is what do I do with my recyclables if I don’t want them to end up on the Vissy pile? ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This programme is broadcast at 7.00pm on Thursday,  April 23rd and 12.00pm on Sunday, April 26th.

Suc Connor talks about spearheading the Campaign against wheelie bins, what we can do to support the campaign and about the inconsistencies and omissions in Council policy and reports. 

Someone suggested to me today that the Cory Road pavement upgrade (oh yes, also unpopular) was in fact to make it easier to collect the wheelie bins!    Of course for that to happen, the left hand would have to know what the right hand was doing …..

Download podcast 

Also, join Anu Grace and friends at Ostend Market on Sunday the 26th to sing Waiheke Does it Better, our very own anti-wheelie song –

WAIHEKE DOES IT BETTER SONG G, D, D7, G

 Recycling it’s so wonderful, our funk from junk is fun
Waiheke’s way is better, coz it involves everyone
We tell our City Council to keep their wheelie bins off our shores
But they are just not listening that’s why Now we got to roar …

 The Visy plant in Auckland’s piling rubbish stories high
While were makin gold of ours under our clear conscience sky
Do you think we want our resource to add to the flies on Onehunga’s pile?
So Keep your wheelie bins in Auckland Central

CHORUS Am, G, Am, G, G, D, D7, C, G, C, G,

If it wasna for recycling just where would we be?

We’d be makin mountains of rubbish and polluting all the sea

But Waiheke does it better so the Royal Commission said

So keep the wheelie bins in Auckland central!

So keep the wheelie bins in Auckland central! 

Why don’t you come along to visit our depot’s clean green bins
And proudly separate your glass and deposit all your tins
Give yourself a pat on the back as you lift the telephone

Tell them “keep your wheelie bins in Auckland central”!

 CHORUS

If it wasna for recycling just where would we be?

We’d be makin mountains of rubbish and polluting all the sea

But Waiheke does it better so the Royal Commission said

So keep the wheelie bins in Auckland central!

So keep the wheelie bins in Auckland central! 

So here’s a message to the council for their committee on the bins
Let us get on with recycling all our paper, glass and tins
Keep your paws of our rubbish and stick to your own policies

And keep your wheelie bins in Auckland central!

CHORUS
If it wasna for recycling just where would we be?

We’d be makin mountains of rubbish and polluting all the sea

But Waiheke does it better so the Royal Commission said

So keep the wheelie bins in Auckland central!

So keep the wheelie bins in Auckland central! 

So keep your wheelie wheelie bins

Keep your wheelie wheelie stupid bins

Keep your wheelie bins in Auckland Central]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[ Sue Bradford talks about being on Waiheke for the supercity hearings, the consequences of her private members bill on child discipline and parental correction, and the current referendum.  

For more information http://yesvote.org.nz/ from which the following is taken.  

  In 2007, by an overwhelming majority of 113 to 8 votes, Parliament granted children protection from assault by their parents. The law is working well but is under threat from a referendum, to be held by postal ballot from 31 July through 21 August 2009. 

The issue is too important to ignore, abstain, or spoil your vote.  Barnardos, Plunket, Unicef and other child focused organisations all support a YES vote.  

Information on Sue Bradford’s Citizens Initiated Referenda (Wording of Questions) Amendment Bill can be found at http://www.greens.org.nz/node/21356

This programme was recorded on 21 July at the supercity hearings.  ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[I talk to Paora Toi-Te-Ranguiaia about Owhiti Bay.  We talk about:

– The importance of the site in archaeological terms

– The relationship between Piritahi Marae and the Ngati and Paoa Trusts

– The importance of the land for Maori

– Paora’s discovery of fossilised shark teeth beads which may be 1,000 years old. 

– The reason for the possible change of heart of the Iwi Trust in supporting the development.

– Paora’s desire to record and photograph artefacts found on the island

If you would like to be part of the project please contact Paora at Apex Studio or on 372 5282.  You can also contact him on paora@ikonz.co.nz

So what’s your view?  Should the development go ahead?  Is the coastline unspoilt?  Should the ground be protected as an archaeological site?

            <description><![CDATA[John Stansfield, executive director of Clean Stream, talks about community support for Clean Stream, the Transition Agency decision to uphold Council’s decision to award a 10 year contract to TPI, what to do with your recyclables now,  as well as engaging with TPI to ensure we have the service we want.    

He quotes the latest figures showing that this year Waiheke has achieved a higher diversion from landfill now than in 1997, with a significantly higher population now than we had then.  ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This goes out on the 12th of February.  I talk to Cathy, founding member of the Campaign for Fair Ferry Fares.  We talk about the recent reduction in ferry fares on Fullers, quite an achievement as fares have never gone down before.

Until the start of 2009, the ferry providers could set the prices they wanted, provided the routes were not subsidised.   This meant that market forces only, determined how the fares are set with potentially devastating consequences to the diversity of our community.  

The Transport Management Act introduced this year means that ARTA (the Auckland Regional Transport Authority) now have the capacity to regulate prices on the route.   I talk with Cathy about the implications of the Act, how fares can be set fairly, and what needs to be done to ensure they are. 

We also talk about the colourful campaigning, involving a coffin protest on Septmeber 1, 2009 when fares were put up last.  Listen to the sea shanty at the end of the show or as a separate podcast below.   This protest was followed by  a Fair Ferry Fairy,   and Piracy on the High Seas protest. 

The public support for the campaign has been immense, with reporting in the local and national newspapers.  We also talk about how the public can participate and support the campaign. 

Look out for the Draft Transport Management Plan for Waiheke which is coming up in April – what are your integrated transport solutions to the island?

If you just want the Fair Ferries sea shanty by Alan Knight and Friends, you can listen to that separately. 

Here’s hoping that the introduction of fair fares will make all this community effort redundant in the coming year!  Until then … happy campaigning.]]></description>
